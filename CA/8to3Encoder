Theory:
An 8:3 encoder (also known as octal-to-ternary encoder) is a combinational circuit that takes eight input lines and produces a three-bit binary output, indicating the position of the most significant (MSB) active input. 
Itâ€™s commonly used in digital systems for encoding data or addressing schemes.


Architecture:

library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
entity encoder is
    Port ( Input_vector : in  STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (7 downto 0);
           Output_vector : out  STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (2 downto 0));
end encoder;

architecture Behavioral of encoder is
begin
    process(Input_vector)
    begin
        case Input_vector is
            when "00000001" => Output_vector <= "000";
            when "00000010" => Output_vector <= "001";
            when "00000100" => Output_vector <= "010";
            when "00001000" => Output_vector <= "011";
            when "00010000" => Output_vector <= "100";
            when "00100000" => Output_vector <= "101";
            when "01000000" => Output_vector <= "110";
            when "10000000" => Output_vector <= "111";
            when others => Output_vector <= "000"; -- default case
        end case;
    end process;
