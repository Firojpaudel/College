Theory:
Parallel adder is a digital circuit capable of finding the arithmetic sum of two binary 
numbers that is greater than one bit in length by operating on corresponding pairs of 
bits in parallel. It consists of full adder connected in a chain where the output carry from 
each full adder is connected to the carry input of the next higher order full adder in a 
chain. A n-bit parallel adder requires n-full adder to perform the operation.
