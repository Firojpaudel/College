Theory:
A 4-to-1 multiplexer (often abbreviated as 4:1 MUX) is a combinational circuit that selects one of four input data lines and forwards it to the output line based on the select lines. 
It's a fundamental building block in digital design and is widely used in various applications, including data routing, signal selection, and control logic.

Architecture:

library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
entity mux is
    port ( A,B,C,D : in STD_LOGIC; 
           S0,S1: in STD_L0GIC;
           Z: out STD_LOGIC);
end mux;

architecture Behavioral of mux is
begin
    process (S0,S1,A,B,C,D)
    begin
        case S1 & S0 is
            when "00" => Z <= A;
            when "01" => Z <= B;
            when "10" => Z <= C;
            when "11" => Z <= D;
            when others => Z <= 'X';
        end case;
    end process;
end Behavioral;
