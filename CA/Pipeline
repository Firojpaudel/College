Theory: 
A 3 segment pipeline is a type of pipeline architecture commonly used in digital systems to improve processing throughput and efficiency.
The pipeline is divided into segments or stages, with each segment responsible for performing specific operation on data.
Y= (a+b)*c

Architecture: 
library IEEE; 
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL; 
use IEEE.NUMERIC_STD.ALL; 
 
entity pipeline is 
    Port ( a : in integer; 
           b : in integer; 
           c : in integer; 
           clk : in STD_LOGIC; 
           y : out integer); 
end pipeline; 
 
architecture Behavioral of pipeline is 
signal r1,r2,r3,r4 : integer :=0; 
begin 
y<=r6; 
process(clk) 
begin 
if(rising_edge(clk)) then 
    for i in 0 to 2 loop 
    case(i) is 
    when 0=> 
    r1<=a; 
    r2<=b; 
    r3<=c; 
    when 1=> 
    r4<=r1+r2; 
    when 2=> 
    r5<=r4*r3; 
    when others=> 
    null; 
    end case; 
    end loop; 
end if; 
end process;
